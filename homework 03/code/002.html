    <h2>Muhammad Ali</h2>

    <h3>Early life and amateur career</h3>
    <p>
        Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. (/ˈkæʃəs/ KASH-əss) was born on January 17, 1942 in Louisville, Kentucky.[26] He had one brother. He was named after his father, Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr., who had a sister and four brothers[27][28] and who himself was named in honor of the 19th-century Republican politician and staunch abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay, also from the state of Kentucky. <br><br>
         Clay's father's paternal grandparents were John Clay and Sallie Anne Clay; Clay's sister Eva claimed that Sallie was a native of Madagascar.[29] He was a descendant of slaves of the antebellum South, and was predominantly of African descent, with some Irish[30] and English family heritage.[31][32] Ali's maternal great-grandfather, Abe Grady, emigrated from Ennis, Co. Clare, Ireland.[33][34] <br><br>
          DNA testing performed in 2018 showed that, through his paternal grandmother, Ali was a descendant of the former slave Archer Alexander, who had been chosen from the building crew as the model of a freed man for the Emancipation Memorial, and was the subject of abolitionist William Greenleaf Eliot's book, The Story of Archer Alexander: From Slavery to Freedom.[35] Like Ali, Alexander fought for his freedom

    <h3>Early professional boxing career</h3>
    <p>
        Clay made his professional debut on October 29, 1960, winning a six-round decision over Tunney Hunsaker. From then until the end of 1963, Clay amassed a record of 19–0 with 15 wins by knockout. He defeated boxers including Tony Esperti, Jim Robinson, Donnie Fleeman, Alonzo Johnson, George Logan, Willi Besmanoff, LaMar Clark, Doug Jones and Henry Cooper. Clay also beat his former trainer and veteran boxer Archie Moore in a 1962 match.[48][49]

    <h3>World heavyweight champion</h3>
    <p>
        By late 1963, Clay had become the top contender for Sonny Liston's title. The fight was set for February 25, 1964, in Miami Beach. <br><br>
         Liston was an intimidating personality, a dominating fighter with a criminal past and ties to the mob. Based on Clay's uninspired performance against Jones and Cooper in his previous two fights, and Liston's destruction of former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson in two first-round knockouts, Clay was a 7–1 underdog. Despite this, Clay taunted Liston during the pre-fight buildup, dubbing him "the big ugly bear", stating "Liston even smells like a bear" and claiming "After I beat him I'm going to donate him to the zoo."[56] Clay turned the pre-fight weigh-in into a circus, shouting at Liston that "someone is going to die at ringside tonight." Clay's pulse rate was measured at 120, more than double his normal 54.[57] <br><br>
          Many of those in attendance thought Clay's behavior stemmed from fear, and some commentators wondered if he would show up for the bout.
